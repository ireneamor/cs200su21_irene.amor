Lab 3 - Fill Triangle

To setup this lab: 
1) Create a new folder in the cs 200 solution directory - you can call it whatever you want. I'll call it "Draw Triangle"
2) Copy the src folder from the latest project we've done (Draw Circle).
3) Copy the contents of this zip file into that folder. Some files will get overwritten: 
    Engine\Rasterizer
    Levels\FreeDraw.cpp
    Levels\GameStates.h
    Engine\DrawTriangle (NEW). 
    Levels\SimpleTriangles.cpp (NEW)
