for this lab, simply create a new directory in your solution directory, you can call it whatever you want, I use '02.Draw Circle'
Copy the src folder from previous assignments into the newly created folder. 
Copy the contents of this zip folder in the directory, this will overwrite some files from the previous assignments. This is by design.
That's it you're done!
